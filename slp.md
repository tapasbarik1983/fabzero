# Stereolithography Printer:-

#### 1. Stereolithography (SL) is one of several methods used to create 3D-printed objects. It's the process by which a uniquely designed 3D printing machine, called a stereolithograph apparatus (SLA) converts liquid plastic into solid objects.

#### It is a form of 3D printing technology used for creating models, prototypes, patterns, and production parts in a layer by layer fashion using photochemical processes by which light causes chemical monomers to link together to form polymers. Stereolithography can be used to create things such as prototypes for products in developing computer hardware, as well as in many other application

# The Process

#### An SLA 3D printer consists of a vat (a resin tank), a build platform, an elevator — used for moving the build platform upwards or downwards — a light source and a pair of galvanometers.

#### The printing process starts with the resin being poured into the vat so that there’s a single layer between the build platform and the bottom. After the build platform is in place, the light source shines through the bottom of the vat, which is transparent, to cure the resin.

#### The light source in most SLA 3D printers is a solid-state laser. When the laser hits the galvanometers, they ensure that the beam is precisely navigated along a particular pattern. When the laser beam “touches” the resin tank, it cures the resin at that specific point. 

#### When the laser finishes the curing process of a single layer, the build platform is elevated by one layer in height and the process is repeated until the part is complete.
